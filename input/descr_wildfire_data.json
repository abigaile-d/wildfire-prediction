        "map": "From the map, it can be observed that more and larger wildfires occur in the western half of the U.S. (including Alaska). This is especially true for wildfires larger than 100k acres.  \n\nThis can be expected as the western states are in the more mountainous areas (e.g. Rocky mountains).",
        "trend": "There is no clear wildfire trend from 1992 to 2015. The wildfire incidents do not increase year by year, and even dropped during 2007 to 2010, and 2012 to 2014. This is the case in both small and large wildfires.",
        "region_and_size": "The states with the most wildfire incidents are: Texas (TX), Mississippi (MS), Alabama (AL), Florida (FL) and Oklahoma (OK). However, very large wildfires (with over 1000 acres or over class F) mostly occur in the states of California (CA), Idaho (ID), Arkansas (AK), Texas (TX) and New Hampshire (NM).  \n\n It is curious that these two groups are comprised of mostly different states. It is good to determine why even though the second group of states have less wildfires than the first group, these wildfires develop into bigger ones.",
        "region_and_size_perc": "More than 80% of wildfires from this dataset are between 10 to 100 acres (class C) and just <5% are larger than 1000 acres (class F & up).\n\n 11.69% of all fire incidents reported have occurred in Texas (TX), while almost 40% of fires larger than 1000 acres  (class F & up) have occurred in just 4 states: California (CA), Idaho (ID), Arkansas (AK) and Texas(TX) (each of these 4 states have ~10%).",

        "state_and_year": "The number of fire incidents in Texas (TX) have significantly jumped from 2005. This can mean that either more fires are happening from 2005, or that reporting has improved from this year.",

        "cause": "The most common cause of wildfires during the available time period is arson (23.84%), followed by debris burning (22.21%), lightning (14.69%) and miscellaneous (13.6%). \n\n For wildfires over 100 acres (class D & up), the most recorded cause is lightning. In addition, more than 50% of wildfires over 1000 acres (class F & up) started with lightning.",
        "cause_and_year": "Arson incidents seem to have decreased in the later years of the period (after 2007). The trend of the rest of the major causes looks to have continued.",
        "cause_and_size": "As mentioned above, lightning caused most of the larger wildfires (greater than 100 acres). It also is the major cause of wildfires on the largest fire size class: G, i.e. it caused 64.11% of wildfires over 5000 acres.",
        "cause_and_state": "The most common causes of wildfires in Texas (TX) are debris burning and miscellaneous, while it is arson in Mississippi (MS) and Alabama (AL). \n\n The most common cause of wildfires over 100 acres (class D & up) is lightning in most of the U.S. states that get many wildfire incidents.",
        "cause_and_state_perc": "Majority of fires caused by arson happened in Oklahoma (OK) (19.5%). Most wildfires caused by lightning and got to a size of over 100 acres (class D & up) also happened in Oklahoma (OK), i.e. 22.24% from all wildfires of this category."
